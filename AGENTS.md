### Always

* Update the mod version when you change something (following semver), only update it once for each feature or patch thats being sent in your prompt so ex u get told to make 5 features and  the version is 1.0.0, youd put all 5 features in 1.1.0
* NEVER supress or use depreicated features, we will always use the correct implentations here.
* make sure your code is on-par with Cleanroom-0.4.2's code requirements.
* Make sure you add the things we do in CHANGELOG.md
